          InProgress .the email address should be a clickable mailto: link
          Done .the text inside $[]$ should be with the same style as in the Summary (so this used to be the hovercard(?)); it's important that we're consistent with this, so everywhere it should be the same. Also, I think it used to be with a style which was kind of un-highlighted - so showing that it's not that important, just an extra info - but now it's bold and highlighted; can we make it less-highlighted, so the text color maybe dark-grey instead of the current black, non-bold, italic and non-highlighted?:

            - Profit-Sharing Model: 
              - An important highlight:  
                - profit-sharing cooperation also means that the role does NOT offer immediate monetary compensation, instead, it provides a share of profits proportional to the contribution and current risks. We'll probably introduce a mixed model as well at later stages though - where there's a base salary
              - ☐ Yes, I acknowledged and accepted the profit-sharing model.

        - Steps:
          - Find a few companies which do websites            
          - Maybe ask on other forums - some junior who wants to do this like how Shadow was?            
          - Ask them - e.g. in an email - with the following content:
            - We're looking for a developer who could do our website now + updates later
            - The site:
              - Simple, static website, hosted on cloudflare
              - pure html + css; we don't want "engines"
              - we provide a specification in a quite formal form
              - Our "role model" is yaml.io
            - [Project description]
            - Situation explained - so our previous developer lost the code and disappeared; we're scrapping the current site and going back to "simple"

                    In "The Abyss" section you can find the management data we're using to manage the project, mirrored to the site quite frequently (we hope we can reach at least daily updates).

                    With this you can at least have some idea about how to manage a (not necessarily just software) project with just a few free tools and well structured yamls - but our main goal is to allow you to experience the daily life of the project and hopefully soon or later be convinced that this is something you at least root for, or, better, you want to support and become part of.
                    

                    The management system general overview


                    Our current - temporary, until the big brother, The F2Tool grows up - management system consists of these yamls in a folder structure stored in a Git repository and read/edited using VS Code (with a few extensions so that we have color coding and reference following). Even though this setup is temporary, the current "interface" of the system - i.e. "reading/editing/querying yamls by VS Code plus a few extensions" - is to stay at least in the first stages of the project: the first versions of The F2Tool will only enhance the experience by adding code completion, error checks, templates, permissions, query and report generation, etc. - and, very importantly, server-side F2Yaml script execution so that we can easily automate stuff.

                    Imagine the system as a task/bug tracking (like JIRA) or ALM system (like codebeamer) replacement - where one works with "Items" (e.g. a "Task", "Bug", "Requirement", each with their own fields, like "Description", "Importance", "Status") which are referencing each other in various ways, can be queried and automated, etc. - with a few important differences:
                      - "coding-like" experience: instead of clicking on websites, you type, using your favorite IDE. Waaaay faster and waay less annoying; you might even start liking management. You can use your favorite text editors, mass replace, mass edit, forget the mouse. No 500 errors, downtimes, "loading"s, bugs.
                      - "total freedom": 
                        - all Item types are yours to change or define; unlimited nesting, full automation possibilities. Even at this current stage it's very easy to automate certain tasks - especially if you use some AI to query those yamls and generate some scripts - but the main reason we're developing a dedicated tool for this is to make automation as easy as possible (as our final goal is to automate everything, including all management processes into it).
                        - no platform or software restrictions - the core of the system is mostly just the conventions and rules, you're free to use any editor, repository or way to edit the files. Even in the era when we'll be using The F2Tool for these the yamls will look the same and serve the same purpose so you can even choose to go off-grid and do everything manually or by using your own software running on your computer you made from sticks and stones.

                Intro:
                  During the design of the language it was a key consideration to make it as easy to read and handle for humans as possible, also, to be able to use widely available software for handling/displaying the f2yaml documents, still, making it relatively easy to process by computer algorithms. F2yaml therefore is based on yaml - i.e. f2yaml documents are also yaml documents - and the syntax is quite loose, allowing the user to express the same thing in multiple ways.

                  Information is stored in entities we call "Items" of various kinds, such as Tasks, Requirements, Articles. Each Item is basically a dictionary, as in a collection of key - value pairs - with some "syntax sugars" to make things easier to read/write.
                  If you have basic object oriented programming knowledge, you can think of Items as instances of objects and we use similar concepts and terminology here - such as the "key"-s are called properties, there's inheritance, we refer to the definition of Items as ClassDescriptions.

                  For example a Task stores information about something which needs to be performed, such as one about cooking a meal could look like:
                    TODO Cook a succulent chinese meal:
                      Type: Task

                  Here the "CreatedBy" (and the rest in light blue) are properties written in a standard way, the "TODO" and "Cook a succulent chinese meal" parts are values of special properties - the "Status" and "Summary" ones in particular; the syntax sugars.

                  Item kinds and their structure can be freely defined by the user - so for example we could create a "Recipe" type of Item containing the instructions about how to make "Bobi's sludge":
                    Bobi's sludge:
                      Type: Recipe
                      Details: A very easy to digest, gut healing, SIBO friendly but still tasty strawberry-vanilla meal-replacement ice-cream
                      Ingredients:
                        - 700g frozen!!! strawberries
                        - 200g dextrose
                        - 350ml yogurt
                        - 60g coconut fat
                        - 60g hydrolized whey powder
                        - 20g l-glutamine powder
                        - 15g partially hydrolized guar gum
                        - 350ml water
                        - optional: vanilla for flavor if the whey powder is unflavored
                      Instructions: |
                        1: add everything in a large bowl
                        2: mix it with a hand blender for ~3 minutes until it becomes a bit whipped
                        3: store it in the freezer - but best before it fully freezes (otherwise microwave it a little)          
                      Notes:
                        - high protein content supporting an active lifestyle; hydrolized = pre-digested
                        - dextrose instead of table sugar for digestibility and inflammation reduction
                        - l-glutamine for restoring gut lining
                        - phgg for feeding the beneficial bacteria in the right place
                        - yogurt for supplying some beneficial bacteria
                        - coconut fat: one of the easiest to digest fats; for energy and lowering glycemic load
                        - strawberries: low sugar; provides texture and taste + antioxidants

                  The Item definition (we call it Class Description) for the above would look like the following - which is also an Item:
                  
                    Recipe:
                      Inherits: Item
                      Details: this defines the Item type "Recipe"
                      Type: ClassDescription
                      Properties:
                        - PropertyId: Ingredients
                          PropertyType: string 
                          IsList: true
                        - PropertyId: Instructions
                          PropertyType: string
                          IsList: false

                  Explanation:
                    - "Inherits: Item": on top of the properties defined in this ClassDescription it include the properties defined in Item - such as "Type" and "Details"; quite handy if we do not want to always re-define commonly used properties
                    - "Details:...": the details (this property is actually defined in Item)
                    - "Type: ClassDescription": this Item is a ClassDescription, used to define other items (also defined in Item)
                    - "Properties: ...": each list entry defines one of the properties of the Recipe Item
                    - "PropertyId: ...": the name (id) of the property
                    - "PropertyType: string": the type of the property is "string"; for non-programmers: this means that it can hold some text (Number would mean it should be a number, Boolean would mean its either "true" or "false", etc.)
                    - "IsList: true": the property is a list

                Now some commonly used notations:
                  Note:
